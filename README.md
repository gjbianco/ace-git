# ace-git

In these guides, you will learn the basics of using git on the command line, as well as using GitLab to contribute code back to a team.

### Installation

#### Windows

Download from git-scm.com

Make sure to include Git Bash as part of the installation (should be selected by default).

#### Linux

Install using your package manager. e.g.

`sudo yum install git` for RHEL and Fedora
`sudo apt-get install git` for Debian and Ubuntu

#### macOS

Install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (preferred), MacPorts, or from git-scm.com

Note: DO NOT use the built-in version from Apple. It is likely very out of date.

### Set up your .gitconfig

Set up your user information with the following commands:

1. `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
2. `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`

These two commands set the "name" and "email" properties in your ~/.gitconfig. You can check/edit this information there.
